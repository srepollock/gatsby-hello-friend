## Well, hello there

My name is Spencer and I'm an avid programmer working to better myself on new and emerging technology.

I've cloned this project from the great work of Radek (@panr) and would like to use it as an example site for more work in the future.

I've just begun my web development journey, but I would like to extend my work out into more aspects of my life as I continue to grow.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you'd like to follow me on my journey, please check out my social links
